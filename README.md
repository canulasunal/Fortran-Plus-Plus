# Fortran++

Fortran++ is a more feature rich and modern subset of Fortran 90. It is designed to bring back Fortran to the area of HPC (high performace computing), but additionally design a language that is close to Fortran's roots, yet be more modern and intuitive. The compiler is written in Nim, and transpiles Fortran++ into vanilla Fortran 90. These is also a small standard library hardcoded into the transpiler which can be used from Fortran++ API.
We are working on the documenation, stay tuned for more info.
